# Braitenberg Vehicles Genetic Algorithms Simulation of Neural Development (BraGenBrain)

Simulation suite for examining neural development in embodied cognition settings. 
The algorithm is based on Genetic Algorithms and hence runs epochs comprised of many agents to find the optimal solution.


## Acknowledgements
This project was started as GSoC '19 project: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6182628703600640. At the final, I wrote a gist summarizing the project expierence during the GSoC: https://gist.github.com/stefanches7/88639248e8260784a7f7c3dfa1d2d6c2.
I want to once again say thanks to Dr. Bradly Alicea for his outstanding mentorship and directions in the project, INCF and Google for supporting the project financially and ideally, as well as my fellow students Jesse Parent, Ziyi Gong, Ankit Gupta as a part of [Orthogonal Research and Education Lab](https://orthogonal-research.weebly.com/) existing purely online for informative meetings and literature exchange!


## Documentation

In-code documentation of the most important functions is collected in one place in `$rootdir/doc/code`.
Jupyter Notebook describing the most important features and ways to run the simulation is located 
at `$rootdir/Documentation.ipynb`. 

### Start 

The application is a runnable `jar`. It is located in the root folder of the project under the name of `BraGenBrain-{VERSION}-XXX.jar`.
Run it in a usual `Java jar` fashion:


### More information

Scientific background of the project, as well as information about its start and planning, are available at GSoC website
as well as in Gist: . 
Furthermore, see files located in `doc\adr` to see more about the technical decisions, that have been undertaken alongside
the development of simulation software.
